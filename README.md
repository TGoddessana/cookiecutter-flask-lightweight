# Cookiecutter Flask Lightweight

A lightweight Flask template for cookiecutter.

## What's the criteria for lightweight?

Actually, 'what I need' is the correct response. Among these essentials are well-maintained extensions, those mundane
repetitive configuration tasks, and of course, support for Docker.
If you've got a brilliant idea for a new feature or just want to shoot the breeze, don't hold back! Feel free to open an
issue or submit a pull request.
And for those curious souls who ask, 'Why don't you have this?' I'll whip out my trusty professional excuse: 'Because
this is a lightweight template! ðŸ˜Ž'
